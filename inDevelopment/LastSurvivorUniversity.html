		<h1 class="title">Additional Details</h1>
		<h2 class="title">Game Concept</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The name of the game will be: Last Survivor University</li>
			<li>It will be a single player adventure and survival game inspired by the LSU campus.</li>
			<li>The game will be done in the style of Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening with the 2.5D art style.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h2 class="title">Story Concept</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The player character is a student at Louisiana State University.</li>
			<li>An important class project was rapidly approaching, so the player secluded themselves in their dorm and worked tirelessly for days to complete the project.</li>
			<li>After they completed and proudly submitted the demanding assignment, the player emerged from their dorm to discover that a mysterious illness had swept through the campus during their self-imposed seclusion.</li>
			<li>The remaining students and employees have mutated into monsters!</li>
			<li>Angry that their masterpiece will never be given the A+ grade it deserves, the player has made a beeline for the Quad.</li>
			<li>The goal: Reclaim the campus from the monsters whose existence has ruined what was supposed to be the player’s achievement!</li>
			<li>The player will start in the quad at the center of campus and follow the path to obtain their first weapon in order to protect themselves as they progress to the next area of the map.</li>
			<li>Once the first weapon is obtained, the player will progress on to enter the first building on the path.</li>
			<li>As if the campus wasn’t dangerous enough, each of the buildings on the progression path are overrun with monsters and “ruled” by unique and powerful boss monsters.</li>
			<li>The enemy bosses will possess an upgraded weapon.</li>
			<li>Once each building boss is defeated, the player will receive the weapon and the building will be designated as a safe zone (respawn point).</li>
			<li>Once all the building bosses have been defeated, the location of the final boss will be discovered.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h2 class="title">Art Style</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>2.5D cartoon-style art</li>
			<li>Mostly 2D graphics with more depth to game elements</li>
		</ul>
